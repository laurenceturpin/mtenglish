    <div class="section">
      <p>Hello! My name’s Morag and I am a native English speaker from the UK. I have the CELTA certificate and am also TESOL qualified. I have taught students from early teens to late seventies at all different levels of English. I have 14 years’
        experience both in the classroom and online. I love to meet people from different countries and cultures. I like talking about literature, arts, society and travel as well as other topics. I am friendly and have a relaxed lesson style which
        will help you feel less nervous so that you can improve your English skills.</p>

      <h2>Me as a Teacher</h2>
      <p>I like to get to know my students as this helps me tailor the lesson to the student’s interests and needs. My lessons are designed to help you become more fluent. A focus on pronunciation will help you to sound natural and I have a standard
        neutral British accent. As my lesson style is relaxed you will feel more confident when speaking and I aim to let students speak as much as possible. I will correct grammar and pronunciation mistakes at the end of the lesson so that you can
        focus on these areas in order to progress. While I have been teaching online, I have used Skype and also Zoom extensively.</p>
      <h2>My Teaching Style</h2>
      <h4>Assessment</h4>
      <p>First of all, I will assess your level so that I know where you need to improve. I prepare each lesson in advance and use a variety of materials to help you learn.</p>
      <h4>Tailored to you, for your personal improvement</h4>
      <p>We would go at your pace and focus on your difficulties with English. We can discuss topics that interest you and in so doing you will learn idiomatic expressions and also vocabulary used by people who speak English fluently.</p>
      <h4>Helpful real-life scenario work</h4>
      <p>Role-play is also useful and if you like we can act out situations such as job interviews, travelling, or eating out etc. If there are certain areas you would like to work on, please let me know.</p>
      <h2>My Teaching Materials</h2>

      <p>Morag and I worked on my frequent pronunciation and grammar mistakes. It is always helpful and enjoyable. Thanks, Morag. - Ma Mei</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'd like to express my gratitude to Morag. I can tell that she put in a lot of effort before our lesson. Lesson materials are tailored to prepare my government exam. We studied government documents and she taught me how to write better to
        get the job. There might be a lot of teachers on italki, but Morag is definitely the best teacher I have ever met. Thank you, Morag! - Vicki Pun</p>
      <br>
      <p>Morag is an excellent, patient teacher. I am very happy about the lesson. - Roman Vacho</p>
      <br>
      <p>Morag has been really enjoyable and it has been a good speaking practice. She has helped me in order to improve my fluency in a simply way and I am really thankful. I will purchase more lessons with her, without any doubt. Thank you so much,
        Morag. - Carmen</p>
